Dockerfile : contains configuration for the container
-> Specify base image
-> Install additional programs
-> Specify command to run on startup

1. Make the Dockerfile (folder attached)

2. Run docker build . 
(for adding a tag)=> docker build -t <dockerid>/<ProjectName>:<version> (usually latest) .

3. Image is built

** For each step (after the base image)in the docker build process: 
1. intermediate containers are built 
2. file system snapshots taken and saved as image
3. intermediate container removed

** The performance of the building process is enhanced by the caching of the file system snapshots (order of commands matters A LOT!-- any changes should be done below for rebuilding image from Dockerfile)

** docker commit is used to create a intermediate usable image for future use (like VM Snapshots)
docker commit <container-id> -options (-c '<executable similar to Dockerfile>')
